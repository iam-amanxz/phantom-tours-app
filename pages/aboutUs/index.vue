        We share a passion for exploring, bikes and the outdoors.
        Guides Aman and Jareer have extensive first-hand knowledge of the routes and destinations on offer. They have built leading industry relations with service providers along the way who offer excellent service, quality products, and exceptional hospitality.
        Each tour with a maximum of 12 clients is accompanied by a backup vehicle with a trained first aider to ensure the safety of the group.
        We have the skills and experience to take you on routes with astonishing diversity while tackling some challenging terrain with either a Honda Africa Twin, or a Honda XR650L.
